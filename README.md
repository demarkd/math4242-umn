#math4242-studentfacing
These are Python3/NumPy based lab activities in JuPyTer for MATH 4242 (Applied Linear Algebra) at the University of Minnesota.
The exercises are based upon and make frequent reference to Applied Linear Algebra, Second Edition by Peter Olver and Chehrzad Shakiban.
Solutions are available by request from David DeMark (demar180@umn.edu), who is also happy to answer any other questions about their content.
Students of courses currently using these activities should contact their instructional team first however.
These are released under a permissive license, but the developer would appreciate knowing if they are used elsewhere.
